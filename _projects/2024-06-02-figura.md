As a Research and Innovation Engineer at [LimaCorporate (now Enovis)](https://limacorporate.com/), a global medical device company, I have developed Figura™, a system for research and development of orthopedic implants consisting of three components:

* **Bone database** – hundreds of anonymized CT image sets and more than 2,400 3D bone models.

* **Open source-based library** – which leverages **machine learning**, **statistical shape modelling** (SSM), and **optimization** techniques to automate time-consuming and otherwise expensive tasks, for instance:

    * mapping elastic properties derived from computed tomography images to a bone finite element mesh (QCT-FEA),
    * inner cortical segmentations (cortical bone mapping),
    * bone  morphometric analyses (femur, humerus, scapula, talus, tibia, and ulna).

    The library is mainly written in Python, and leverages also Scala for SSM, and HTML/CSS for the documentation. Procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms are used throughout the codebase. It is version controlled using Git and stored in Azure DevOps repositories where I have implemented CI/CD pipelines for testing and linting.

* **CAD plug-ins** – to automate virtual surgeries and bone reconstructions within the CAD environment.

The system empowers product development engineers with data and tools to make their design activities more **effective** and **efficient**. Furthermore, the tool was used and cited in a [peer-reviewed research article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jor.70038) published in the **Journal of Orthopaedic Research** (Q1) and in projects presented at orthopaedic conferences, such as the [ISTA](https://www.istaonline.org/meetings/ista-2024-annual-congress-new/).

Moreover, I have developed several **graphical user interfaces** (GUIs) that leverage Figura, as well as PyQt5, PyQtGraph, and PyVista libraries, for processing, visualizing, and interacting with complex 2D and 3D data. I have bundled these GUIs and released them to my colleagues at work to facilitate their day-to-day engineering activities. For instance, one of these GUIs allows the product development engineers to perform QCT-FEA analyses on their own, while another one enables 2D surgery planning.
