Team DIANA is a space robotics group at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en) run by students. The group designs and manufactures prototypes of wheeled planetary rovers.

The acronym DIANA stands for *Ducti Ingenio Accipimus Naturam Astrorum*, which translates to *guided by ingenuity, we understand [receive] the nature of the stars*.

DIANA was born in 2008 and Professor Emeritus [Giancarlo Genta](https://www.dimeas.polito.it/en/personale/scheda/(nominativo)/giancarlo.genta/(sezione)/didattica) was its academic advisor until 2018. Currently, the group is led by Professor [Fabrizio Stesina](https://www.dimeas.polito.it/en/personale/scheda/(nominativo)/fabrizio.stesina); [Leonardo Festa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-maria-festa/) is the Team Leader, [Alessandro Meloni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-meloni/) is the Project Manager and Edoardo Vacchetto is the Assembly Integration and Test manager.

I joined the group in 2012 and I was promoted to team leader the following year. I led the team until 2015 when I got my MSc in Aerospace Engineering. [During my PhD]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/2022-07-24-phd.md %}) I continued to work with the team by mentoring younger students and providing support for the development of the prototypes. Even today, that I am no longer a student, I enjoy to keep in touch with the team and marvel at the progress made so far.

As team leader I had to manage tens of students coming from different countries and having diverse engineering backgrounds. I took care of recruitment and training activities, managed the budget and the network of suppliers and guided the development of the version 3.0 of the *AMALIA* prototype.

From a technical standpoint, I focused on structural and multibody dynamics analyses of the mobility system using software like [Patran](https://www.mscsoftware.com/product/patran)/[Nastran](https://www.mscsoftware.com/product/msc-nastran), [Adams](https://www.mscsoftware.com/product/adams) e [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)/[Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html). In 2014 I started a fruitful collaboration with [MSC Software](https://www.mscsoftware.com/) that led to the development, for instance, of multibody analyses of the [*AMALIA* 3.0](https://www.mscsoftware.com/it/page/analisi-dinamica-di-un-rover-interplanetario) and [*T0-R0*](https://www.mscsoftware.com/it/page/simulazione-dinamica-multibody-del-rover-t0-r0-la-european-rover-challenge) prototypes.

Today the team is doing better than ever developing new and more sophisticated vehicles and taking part in the [European Rover Challenge](https://roverchallenge.eu/en/main-page/), an international event where groups of students showcase their planetary rovers and compete with each other in a series of challenging tasks.

I would like to conclude this post with two image galleries. The first one shows all the prototypes developed by the team so far in chronological order.

The second one is a collection of pictures taken over the years.
