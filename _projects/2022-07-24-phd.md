In 2015 I won a PhD scholarship at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en) in Aerospace Engineering. My research focused on assessing the tractive performance of flexible wheels for lightweight planetary rovers using a 3D multibody-discrete element co-simulation framework. My PhD advisor was Professor Emeritus [Giancarlo Genta](https://www.dimeas.polito.it/en/personale/scheda/(nominativo)/giancarlo.genta/(sezione)/didattica).

Unfortunately, due to family and economic issues, in April 2019, after more than three years of research, I had to drop out of my PhD programme.

Since the beginning of my academic journey, I had to constantly travel back and forth to stay close to my family located in Northeast Italy. This situation became particularly tough to bear during my PhD, but I didn't give up and moved forward. However, in 2018 the situation got worse and it became clear to me that I had to relocate back to my hometown. Moreover, my scholarship was about to expire and I had a student loan to pay back (and still have), so I looked for a job near home and got hired by [Limacorporate](https://limacorporate.com/), which is not so much into space robotics, nonetheless I managed to adapt to the needs of the biomedical industry. I started this job in September 2018 and, in the meantime, I continued to work remotely on my research at night and during weekends.

To be able to defend a PhD thesis, the Aerospace department required to attend a minimum number of hours of both technical and soft skills courses, to publish one paper in an international conference and one article in a top-tier journal. The latter was the issue. I managed to submit the paper to the [Journal of Field Robotics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15564967) in September 2018. You can download the [**submitted paper**](/img/projects/2022-07-24-phd\Pizzamiglio_Genta_Cofano_JFR_2018.pdf) and [**raw data**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PDFDoCHv2f6k6FkiuaHANUYXbXBCT2fi?usp=sharing). Two reviewers didn't accept the article mainly due to the sinkage results and asked me to improve the numerical model. For doing so I needed to perform additional experimental tests and run a new co-simulation campaign. At this point I was running out of time, so I asked my university for a deadline extension but the request was denied. A few days before the final deadline I dropped out of the programme.

My research activity can be broken down as follows.
* **Designing and building the single-wheel test bench**. I inherited a test bench developed years earlier, but it featured several design mistakes that made it impossible to use it for testing wheels on soft soils; moreover, the bench didn't allow to carry out tests at varying slip ratios. I kept the chassis and the linear guide, but I had to re-design and build all the other mechanical parts.  Whenever possible I used off-the-shelf components to cut costs. The test bench was located at [Verrès (Aosta)](https://www.verres.polito.it/).

* **Testing the wheel**. I performed several experimental tests on the elastic wheel of the [AMALIA rover]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/2022-07-21-diana.md %}) on a martian soil simulant at varying slip ratios. The soil was provided by [ALTEC](https://www.altecspace.it/). I recorded force and torque data from the load cell, and sinkage data from a draw-wire displacement sensor.

* **Testing the soil**. The physical properties of the soil were investigated at the [International Research School of Planetary Sciences](https://www.irsps.eu/). I had the opportunity to go there and to learn how soils are analyzed. Direct shear, triaxial and angle of repose tests were performed.

* **Implementation of a semi-empirical model**. Based on [Wong (2009)](https://books.google.it/books?hl=en&lr=&id=s1W9kozKg18C&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Terramechanics+and+o%3F-road+vehicle+engineering:+terrain+behaviour,+o%3F-road+vehicle+performance+and+design&ots=oJLLJtbbcZ&sig=QxdGRPCewHhqW1lrkrWIUJko6Yc&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Terramechanics%20and%20o%3F-road%20vehicle%20engineering%3A%20terrain%20behaviour%2C%20o%3F-road%20vehicle%20performance%20and%20design&f=false), [Ishigami (2011)](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:586863/FULLTEXT01.pdf) and [Favaedi (2011)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022489811000188), I implemented in [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) a semi-empirical model to predict the performance of flexible wheels.

* **Development of the EDEM/Adams co-simulation framework**. The soil was modelled using the [EDEM](https://www.altair.com/edem/?utm_source=adwords&utm_term=%2Bedem&utm_campaign=EDEM+Competitor+Displacement+-+Search&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_mt=b&hsa_ad=431842643899&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_src=g&hsa_kw=%2Bedem&hsa_tgt=kwd-301337310600&hsa_cam=9896100699&hsa_acc=8794474896&hsa_ver=3&hsa_grp=103057779049&gclid=CjwKCAjwgaeYBhBAEiwAvMgp2hyI83qDJXIFzXw5qgL9QRXYEyl9mtcZAYVMYvF3BAwKX4-TCu8D-hoCghYQAvD_BwE) software for discrete element simulations, while the flexible wheel was modelled using the [Adams](https://www.mscsoftware.com/it/product/adams) software. The two software interacted with each other by running a [co-simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-simulation).

* **Development of the multibody model of the flexible wheel**. At that time, the EDEM/Adams co-simulation framework didn't support flexible parts generated using, for instance, the [component mode synthesis](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/3.4741) technique. Therefore, I mimicked the wheel flexibility by discretizing the rim with a number of segments, i.e. rigid bodies connected by revolute joints and rotational spring-dampers, and by replacing the radial circular beams with translational spring-dampers. I automated the construction of the multibody model of the wheel by writing a script using the [Adams command language](https://help.hexagonmi.com/bundle/adams_2022.1/page/adams_help/Adams_Basic_Package/view_cmd/overview/overview.xhtml).

* **Calibration of the discrete element parameters**. Reproducing the bulk behavior of the soil modelled as an assemblage of discrete particles required to accurately estimate a set of micro-scale input parameters, such as particle size, shape, Young's modulus, etc. The approach I adopted was to carry out discrete element simulations of the direct shear and angle of repose tests and to iteratively changed the parameter values until the numerical model showed a macroscopic behavior
comparable with the measured bulk response of the soil.

* **Running the co-simulations**. Once the discrete element parameters were estimated, the experimental single-wheel tests were repeated in the EDEM/Adams co-simulation environment. This step and the previous one were the most demanding and time consuming.

* **Comparing semi-empirical and numerical model results**. Regarding the drawbar pull, the discrete element model showed good agreement with the experimental results, especially at low slips (0.0÷0.2). The semi-empirical model performed well at low slips but a discrepancy was evident at higher slips (0.4÷0.6). The discrete element model gave better approximation of the sinkage, with respect to the classical model, in particular at slips ranging from 0.4 to 0.6.

* **Mobility simulation of the AMALIA and T0-R0 vehicles**. Lastly, I used the methodology developed to simulate the wheel-soil interaction of the AMALIA and T0-R0 prototypes developed by [Team DIANA]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/2022-07-21-diana.md %}). The analyses were published on the [EDEM website](https://altairuniversity.com/51379-edem-research-spotlight-modelling-wheel-soil-interaction-for-planetary-rovers-with-edem-adams-dem-mbd).

That's my research in a nutshell.

Looking back, maybe I shouldn't have started a PhD programme given the situation I had to cope with, but honestly I can't imagine myself giving up without trying. In addition, my career goal was to become a professor.

But for sure I am grateful for all the amazing people I have met and all the wonderful experiences I have enjoyed over the  years at Politecnico di Torino.
